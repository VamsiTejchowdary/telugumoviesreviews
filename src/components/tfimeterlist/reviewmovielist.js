Bound script, tight screenplay, crisp runtime added value to the movie. Actors Dulqer Salman, Meenakshi Choudary did their best and the supporting characters also performed well. Even though some scenes feels like illogical, most of the movie makes sense. The writing and directing part by Venky Atluri outstands. Worth watching.\"" }, // Lucky Bhaskar
